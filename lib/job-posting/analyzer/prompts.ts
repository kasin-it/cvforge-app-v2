## EXTRACTION RULES

**1. title**
- Extract the specific job role.
- **Clean:** Remove buzzwords, location, salary, or internal codes (e.g., convert "URGENT: Senior React Dev - Remote - $150k (J-202)" to "Senior React Developer").

**2. tags** (Atomic Keywords for ATS Matching)
- Extract a COMPREHENSIVE list of atomic keywords (1-3 words max).
- **Goal:** These tags will be used for keyword density matching. Be EXHAUSTIVE - extract 30-50+ tags minimum.

**CATEGORIES TO EXTRACT (do not skip ANY):**

**A. ALL Programming Languages & Frameworks (extract EVERY one mentioned):**
- Languages: JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, Go, Rust, PHP, Ruby, C#, Kotlin, Swift, etc.
- Frameworks: React, Angular, Vue, Next.js, Node.js, Express, Django, Flask, Spring, Laravel, Symfony, Rails, .NET, etc.
- Include BOTH if language and framework are mentioned (e.g., "PHP" AND "Symfony" separately)

**B. Testing & Quality (extract even if implied):**
- If job mentions "quality", "reliable code", "well-tested" -> extract: "testing", "quality engineering", "code quality"
- Testing types: "unit testing", "integration testing", "e2e testing", "TDD", "BDD"
- Testing tools: Jest, Cypress, Playwright, PHPUnit, pytest, JUnit, etc.
- Quality concepts: "quality assurance", "QA", "test automation", "testable code"

**C. Engineering Practices & Principles:**
- Architecture: "microservices", "monolith", "modularity", "modular architecture", "clean architecture", "DDD"
- Design: "design patterns", "SOLID", "OOP", "functional programming"
- Practices: "code review", "pair programming", "agile", "scrum", "kanban", "CI/CD"
- Thinking skills: "complex systems thinking", "problem solving", "analytical thinking", "system design"

**D. Business Domain & Industry (CRITICAL - often missed):**
- Industry: "travel", "fintech", "e-commerce", "healthcare", "SaaS", "B2B", "enterprise"
- Specific domains: "online travel agency", "OTA", "travel data", "booking systems", "payments", "banking"
- If company type is mentioned, extract it: "startup", "scale-up", "enterprise"

**E. Infrastructure & DevOps:**
- Cloud: AWS, GCP, Azure, DigitalOcean (individually)
- Containers: Docker, Kubernetes, k8s
- Databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, Elasticsearch
- Tools: Terraform, Ansible, Jenkins, GitHub Actions

**F. Soft Skills & Methodologies:**
- Collaboration: "team leadership", "mentoring", "cross-functional collaboration"
- Communication: "stakeholder communication", "documentation", "technical writing"
- Methodologies: Agile, Scrum, Kanban, Lean

**G. Implicit Skills (infer from context):**
- "scale" or "high traffic" -> "scalability", "performance optimization", "high availability"
- "multiple services" -> "distributed systems", "microservices"
- "complex codebase" -> "complex systems thinking", "legacy code", "refactoring"
- "modular" or "reusable" -> "modularity", "component design", "reusability"
- "maintain" or "maintainable" -> "code maintainability", "clean code"

**3. skills** (Key Requirements - CONCISE)
- Extract core requirements as SHORT phrases (not full sentences).
- Focus on: years of experience + technology/skill
- Keep each skill to under 10 words when possible
- Include both explicit AND implied requirements
- **Examples:**
  - *Good:* "5+ years PHP/Symfony experience"
  - *Good:* "Experience with travel/OTA domain"
  - *Good:* "Strong testing and quality engineering mindset"
  - *Bad:* "We are looking for a candidate with at least 5 years of commercial experience..."

You are an expert ATS (Applicant Tracking System) parser. Your goal is to analyze the provided job posting and extract ALL data that could help optimize a candidate's CV for maximum ATS match.

Analyze the text thoroughly and output a JSON object. Be EXHAUSTIVE - missing a keyword means a worse ATS score.

## RESPONSE FORMAT

Output **only** a raw JSON object matching this structure exactly:

{
  "title": "string",
  "tags": ["string", "string", ...],  // AIM FOR 30-50+ TAGS
  "skills": ["string", "string", ...]
}

## JOB POSTING CONTENT
${content}
